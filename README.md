Scrapes product data from [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/).

  </tr>
</table>

2. Run `composer install`
3. Start a PHP/web server in the project root
4. Visit `index.php` in your browser

This is a simple example of data scraping. I enjoy exploring web scraping and often experiment with different stacks,
including PHP.
